;;; Commentary:
;; A dedicated major `notdeft-mode' for use in displaying search
;; results. The implementation is derived from code in Deft.
;;
;; This feature is optional, and need not be loaded in order to use
;; core NotDeft functionality. Some commands defined here (like
;; `notdeft' and `notdeft-open-query') are autoloadable in order to
;; allow a NotDeft buffer to be opened before the feature has been
;; loaded.

;; File Browser

;; The NotDeft buffer is simply a local search engine result browser
;; which lists the titles of all text files matching a search query
;; (entered by first pressing TAB or `C-c C-o`), followed by short
;; summaries and last modified times. The title is taken to be the
;; first line of the file (or as specified by an Org "TITLE" file
;; property) and the summary is extracted from the text that follows.
;; By default, files are sorted in terms of the last modified date,
;; from newest to oldest.

;; Searching and Filtering

;; NotDeft's primary operations are searching and filtering. The list
;; of files matching a search query can be further narrowed down using
;; a filter string, which will match both the title and the body text.
;; To initiate a filter, simply start typing. Filtering happens on the
;; fly. As you type, the file browser is updated to include only files
;; that match the current string.

;; To open the first matching file, simply press `RET`.  If no files
;; match your filter string, pressing `RET` will create a new file
;; using the string as the title.  This is a very fast way to start
;; writing new notes.  The filename will be generated automatically.

;; To open files other than the first match, navigate up and down
;; using `C-p` and `C-n` and press `RET` on the file you want to open.

;; Press `C-c C-c` to clear the filter string and display all files
;; and `C-c e` to refresh the file browser using the current
;; filter string.

;; Static filtering is also possible by pressing `C-c C-l`.  This is
;; sometimes useful on its own, and it may be preferable in some
;; situations, such as over slow connections or on older systems,
;; where interactive filtering performance is poor.

;; Common file operations can also be carried out from within a
;; NotDeft buffer. Files can be renamed using `C-c C-r` or deleted
;; using `C-c C-d`. New files can also be created using `C-c C-n` for
;; quick creation or `C-c C-m` for a filename prompt. You can leave a
;; `notdeft-mode' buffer at any time with `C-c C-q`, which buries the
;; buffer, or kills it with a prefix argument `C-u`.

;; Archiving unused files can be carried out by pressing `C-c C-a`.
;; Files will be moved to `notdeft-archive-directory' under the note
;; file's NotDeft data directory. The archive directory is by default
;; named so that it gets excluded from searches.

;; Launching

;; Once you have NotDeft installed (with the necessary autoloads) you
;; can then run `M-x notdeft` to create a `notdeft-mode' buffer.
;; Alternatively, you may find it convenient to execute `M-x
;; notdeft-open-query` to enter a search query from anywhere, which
;; then also opens a `notdeft-mode' buffer for displaying the results.
